    "### Matplotlib History\n",
    "\n",
    "* Created by John Hunter (1968 - 2012)\n",
    "   - It was created by John Hunter, who was an American neurobiologist. John Hunter was part of a research team analyzing electro CTO cartography, ECoG signals, and use proprietary software for this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Matlab based version of a propriety software\n",
    "   - However, the team had only one license and was taking turns using it. To overcome this limitation, John Hunter set out to replace the proprietary software with a Matlab based version that could be utilized by him and his teammates and extended by multiple investigators.\n",
    "\n",
    "* EEG/ECoG Vsualization Tool\n",
    "   - As a result, Matplotlib was initially developed as an EEG and ECoG visualization tool. Just like Matlab, Matplotlib was equipped with a scripting interface for quick and easy generation of graphics represented by the plot. "

    "### Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "As for Matplotlib's architecture, it's composed of **three** main layers. \n",
    "\n",
    "     Scripting Layer (pyplot)                      \n",
    "                |                                  \n",
    "                |                                  \n",
    "     Artist Layer (Artist)                         \n",
    "                |                                  \n",
    "                |                                  \n",
    "     Backend Layer (FigureCanvas, Renderer, Event) \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Backend Layer\n",
    "The backend layer has three built-in abstract interface classes. \n",
    "\n",
    "a. **FigureCanvas** defines end encompasses the area on which the figure is drawn. \n",
    "\n",
    "`matplotlib.backend_bases.FigureCanvas`\n",
    "\n",
    "b. **Renderer**, an instance of the renderer class knows how to draw on figure canvas. \n",
    "\n",
    "`matplotlib.backend_bases.Renderer`\n",
    "\n",
    "c. The **event** handles user inputs such as keyboard strokes and mouse clicks.\n",
    "\n",
    "`matplotlib.backend_bases.Event`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Artist Layer\n",
    "Artist layer, where much of the heavy lifting happens, is the appropriate programming paradigm when writing a web application server, a UI application, or a script to be shared with other developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Comprised of one main object - **Artist**\n",
    "   - Knows how to use the Renderer to draw on the Canvas\n",
    "\n",
    "* Everything in a Matplotlib figure is an artist instance. \n",
    "   - The title, the lines, the tick labels, the images, and so on, all correspond to an individual artist. \n",
    "   \n",
    "* There are two types of artist objects. \n",
    "   a. **Primitive**: Line2D, Rectangle, Circle, and Text. \n",
    "   b. **Composite**: Axis, Tick, Axes, and Figure. \n",
    "      - The most important composite artist is the axis because it's where most of the Matplotlib API plotting methods are defined, including methods to create and manipulate the ticks, the axis lines, the grid, and the plot background.\n",
    "   \n",
    "    - The top-level Matplotlib object that contains and manages all the elements in each graphic is the **figure artist**.  \n",
    "    - Each composite artists may contain other composite artists as well as primitive artists. \n",
    "    - A figure artists can have an axis artist, a rectangle, and a text artist. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The artist layer is syntactically heavy. Programmers work directly with the backend and artists layers as they offer greater convenience while integrating Matplotlib with application servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Scripting Layer\n",
    "The scripting layer is the appropriate layer for everyday purposes. It's considered a lighter scripting interface to simplify common tasks and for quick and easy generation of graphics and plots. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is comprised mailnly of Plotly, a scripting interface lighter than the Artist layer.    \n",
    "It's simple to work in the scripting layer. \n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to the daily tasks of scientists involving data visualization or exploratory interactions, the scripting layer known as Pyplot works better. \n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib scripting layer is the `matplotlib.pyplot` interface, which automatically defines a Canvas and a figure artist instance and connects them. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, generate a histogram of 10,000 random numbers with the scripting layer. \n",
    "\n",
    "* import the Pyplot interface \n",
    "   - `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`\n",
    "* use of Numpy's random module with random.randn for creating random floats \n",
    "   - `import numpy as np`\n",
    "   - `x = np.random.randn(10000)`\n",
    "* from the Pyplot call hist method \n",
    "   - `plt.hist(x, 100)`\n",
    "* To the hist function, the variable X icontaining an array of 10,000 random numbers and 100 is passed, which means creating 100 bins. \n",
    "* The result is a histogram. "

    "### Components of a Plot\n",
    "\n",
    "The **anatomy of a plot** refers to the different components and elements that make up a visual representation of data. \n",
    " \n",
    "* The main component is the `window` or `Canvas` containing the plot or subplots. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Matplotlib `figure` as a Canvas and `axis` represents an individual plot within a figure, first create two-axis parts to make two plots on one figure, the axis provides scales and tick marks for plotting the data. \n",

    "* The actual data being plotted is represented as `points` or `markers` on the plot like the axis. \n",
    "\n",
    "* A good plot must have a `title` to provide a summary or explanation of the plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Likewise, `labels` describe data being plotted on each axis. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Include a `legend` to explain the meaning of different elements or data series and applaud a `grid` to help visually aligned data points and aid and reading values from the plot and `annotations` to provide supplemental information or explanations about specific data points are regions in the plot. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Choose `symbols` for individual data point, colors, and styles. "
